# Andrei Sorin Stefan — Backend, Automation & Data Engineering
I'm a Full-Stack & Automation Engineer with a strong focus on backend systems, data extraction (ETL), 
and browser automation. I build practical, reliable tools designed to solve real-world problems —
from complex scrapers to full web platforms with authentication, dashboards, and API backends.

My work combines:
• Backend engineering (Python, Django, FastAPI, Node.js, Spring Boot)
• Frontend development (Vue 3, React, Next.js)
• Web automation & anti-bot systems (Selenium, undetected-chromedriver)
• ETL pipelines, data modeling, data cleaning, scoring, and analysis
• Linux, servers, deployment, monitoring, and system design

I enjoy building systems that are:
• maintainable
• resilient under real traffic
• configuration-driven
• production-ready even when running locally
• transparent and easy to extend

##  Technical Skills

### **Backend**
• Python (Selenium, asyncio, ETL pipelines, parsing engines)
• Django REST Framework
• FastAPI
• Node.js
• Kotlin + Spring Boot (configuration-driven backend architecture)
• SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
• Data modeling, normalization, scoring systems

### **Automation & Scraping**
• Selenium / Undetected-Chromedriver
• Anti-bot evasion: fingerprinting, cookies, session isolation
• Multi-session browser automation
• Dynamic page interactions (forms, JS content, pagination)
• Human-behavior simulation
• Robust logging, resume logic, offline caching
• Large-scale HTML → JSON transformation

### **Frontend**
• Vue 3 (SPA, Composition API)
• React / Next.js
• TailwindCSS
• Interactive dashboards (Tabulator.js) for data analytics

### **DevOps & Systems**
• Linux (Ubuntu, Debian) – daily driver  
• Shell scripting, process management, PID handling  
• API integrations (JSON / REST)  
• CI-ready architecture  
• Local production-like environments

##  Representative Work

### **1. ParkingList.de – Small but Complex ETL Scraper**
A resilient scraper with 70+ date combinations/airport, resume logic, multi-stage processing, HTML archival, JSON structuring and dynamic browser automation.

Built with:
• `undetected-chromedriver`
• Selenium
• Multi-stage ETL (HTML → TXT → JSON)
• Anti-bot awareness  
• Automatic archival & progress tracking  
• Production-grade logic despite the small scope  

(Project on GitHub)

---

### **2. Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist Car Scanner + Live Dashboard**
A full local ecosystem consisting of:
• Scraper (Selenium + human simulation)  
• Extractor (data modeling, cleaning, scoring)  
• Dashboard (Flask API + Tabulator.js)  
• YAML configuration system  
• PID-controlled Start/Stop mechanisms  
• Direct linking to original listings

### **3. EnergieJungle Lead Routing Demo (Kotlin + Vue 3)**
End-to-end prototype demonstrating:
• dynamic questionnaire generation  
• scoring engine  
• partner eligibility  
• routing logic  
• clean REST architecture  
Frontend in Vue 3, backend in Kotlin + Spring Boot.

---

### **4. VorteLab Platform**
A real production ecosystem:
• Django REST API backend  
• Vue 3 login system  
• JWT authentication  
• Internal chat system  
• Next.js presentation website  
All deployed and live.

##  What I Focus On

• Efficient, predictable, maintainable systems  
• Clean architecture over “fast hacks”  
• Real-world constraints: rate limits, performance, UX, stability  
• Transparent logic and strong documentation  
• Projects that provide **value**, not complexity for the sake of complexity
