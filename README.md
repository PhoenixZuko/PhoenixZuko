# Andrei Sorin Stefan — Backend, Automation & Data Engineering

Senior Backend & Automation Engineer experienced in designing scalable systems, data extraction pipelines (ETL), and advanced browser automation. I build reliable, production-oriented solutions designed for real-world constraints such as rate limits, dynamic UIs, anti-bot systems, and multi-step workflows.
My work spans backend architecture, distributed automation, and full-stack development, always prioritizing maintainability, clarity, and long-term stability.

## Core Strengths

### Backend Engineering
- Python (Selenium, asyncio, multiprocessing, ETL workflows)
- Django REST Framework, FastAPI, Flask
- Kotlin + Spring Boot (clean, configuration-driven architecture)
- Node.js (Express, API backends)
- SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- Data modeling, scoring engines, normalization, ORMs
- Production-grade API design and backend architecture

### Automation & Web Scraping
- Selenium / Undetected-Chromedriver
- Anti-bot strategies: fingerprinting, cookies, session isolation
- Human-behavior simulation & realistic automation patterns
- Dynamic interaction automation (filters, modals, JS content)
- Multi-session automation with PID & process control
- Robust extractors with retry queues, caching, resume logic
- Full ETL processing: HTML → text → structured JSON → database

### Frontend Engineering
- Vue 3 (SPA, Composition API)
- React / Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- High-performance dashboards using Tabulator.js

### DevOps & Systems
- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine)
- Shell scripting, CRON automation, process management
- Dockerized local production-like environments
- Server deployment, monitoring, debugging
- API integrations (REST/JSON), authentication flows
- CI/CD-ready project structure

## Representative Projects

### 1. ParkingList.de – Multi-Stage ETL Platform
A robust ETL pipeline scraping 70+ date combinations per airport.  
Key capabilities:
- undetected-chromedriver automation
- multi-stage transformation pipeline
- HTML archival, JSON structuring, normalization
- anti-bot adaptation
- checkpoint-based resume logic

**Stack:** Python, Selenium (undetected), ETL pipeline, JSON modeling.

---

### 2. AutoMarketFlow – Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist Scanner + Live Dashboard
A complete local ecosystem running entirely on the client’s machine:
- controlled browser automation (human-like behaviour)
- extractor + classifier + scoring engine
- Flask dashboard with real-time filtering
- YAML configuration system
- multi-process PID supervision
- persistent Chrome profile
- safe execution environment with zero cloud dependencies

**Stack:** Python, Selenium, Flask, Tabulator.js, YAML automation.

---

### 3. EnergieJungle – Lead Routing Prototype (Kotlin + Vue 3)
End-to-end prototype implementing:
- dynamic questionnaire generation (JSON-driven)
- scoring engine
- partner eligibility logic
- clean REST interface
- Kotlin Spring Boot backend + Vue 3 frontend

A scalable foundation designed to evolve into the platform’s MVP.

---

### 4. VorteLab – Production Platform (Django + Vue 3 + Next.js)
Delivered a multi-service ecosystem:
- Django REST backend with JWT authentication
- Vue 3 login and user system
- Internal chat system
- Next.js marketing website

Production deployment included.

## Engineering Philosophy

- Clear, explicit architecture  
- Maintainability over hacks  
- Predictable behaviour under real-world conditions  
- Strong documentation and transparency  
- Practical value, not artificial complexity  

I specialize in projects where backend logic, automation, and data processing converge — delivering stable, maintainable systems.
