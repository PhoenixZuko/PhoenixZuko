# Hi, I’m Andrei Sorin Ștefan (PhoenixZuko)

I design and build reliable backend systems, automation tools and data-processing pipelines.  
My focus is on Python development, ETL workflows, Linux systems, browser automation, and web integration.

I enjoy projects where stability, correctness and clean system logic matter more than “quick hacks”.

## 🔧 Core Competencies

### **Backend & Automation**
- Python (automation, data extraction, backend APIs)
- ETL flows: data collection → transformation → structured export (JSON, SQL, CSV)
- Complex browser automation (Selenium + undetected-chromedriver)
- High-stability scraping systems with resume logic & error recovery
- API integration (REST, JWT auth, JSON/YAML pipelines)

### **System Engineering**
- Strong experience working in Linux environments (Ubuntu, Debian)
- Shell scripting & CLI tooling (process control, automation, monitoring)
- Server-side deployment, service configuration, SSH, environment hardening
- Performance tuning for automation workloads

### **Web & Application Development**
- Django & Django REST Framework (authentication, API design, admin tools)
- Vue.js & React (dashboards, modern UI, integrations)
- Node.js utilities and API consumers
- SQL databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite

### **Data, AI & Media Processing**
- Structured data parsing, validation and normalization
- JSON/YAML configuration systems
- ONNX Runtime for fast inference workloads
- FFmpeg + OpenCV for automated video/image processing

## 🔍 Areas of Interest
- ETL pipelines and automated data extraction  
- Reliable backend systems with clean architecture  
- Automation frameworks for web interaction and data flows  
- Linux-based deployments and scripting  
- AI-aware media processing (watermark detection, transformation)  

---

## 🚀 Representative Work
- **ParkingList Data Extractor (Selenium Pipeline)**  
  Multi-stage ETL system: browser automation → HTML capture → text parsing → JSON structuring  
  Includes checkpointing, resume logic, and fault tolerance.

- **Django + Vue Authentication System**  
  Full user system with JWT, registration, login, protected routes and admin tools.

- **Video Watermark Detection Engine**  
  ONNX + OpenCV + FFmpeg pipeline for automated batch processing.

- **Automation Utilities**  
  Multiple Python scripts for monitoring, scraping, reporting and data cleanup.

(Additional projects are being cleaned, refactored and documented before publication.)
