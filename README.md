# Hi, I’m Andrei Sorin Ștefan (PhoenixZuko)

I build practical, reliable and well-structured software systems with a focus on:
- automation,
- backend development,
- data extraction pipelines,
- and system integration.

My work spans from small but technically complex automation tools to full backend architectures using Django, APIs, and modern web technologies. I enjoy solving real problems through clean code, efficient data handling and stable system design.

## 🔧 Technical Skills

### **Programming**
- Python (automation, scraping, backend APIs, AI/ML inference)
- JavaScript / TypeScript (Vue, React, Node.js)
- PHP (API services, backend utilities)
- Shell Scripting (Linux automation)
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)

### **Frameworks & Tools**
- **Django & DRF** – backend architectures, authentication, data processing  
- **Vue.js / React** – frontend interfaces and dashboards  
- **Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests** – scraping & browser automation  
- **Linux Server Management** – security, deployment, automation  
- **FFmpeg & OpenCV** – video processing, watermark detection, AI pipelines  
- **ONNX Runtime** – optimized inference workloads  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control, clean repository structure

## 🔍 Areas of Interest
- Browser automation and anti-bot-resistant data collectors  
- API-driven systems and backend architectures  
- Data processing pipelines (JSON, YAML, ETL flows)  
- AI-based video/image processing  
- Optimizing automation workflows for stability and performance  

---

## 🚀 Selected Work
I develop both end-to-end applications and compact automation tools.  
A few examples include:

- **ParkingList Data Extractor** – multi-stage Selenium pipeline with resumable execution  
- **Django + Vue authentication platform (JWT)** – complete login/registration system  
- **Video watermark detection (ONNX + OpenCV + FFmpeg)** – automated batch processor  
- **Python automation suites** for data collection, reporting & scheduled tasks  

More repositories are being reviewed, documented and published progressively.

## 🎯 Current Goals
- Improving how automation tools integrate with modern web applications  
- Expanding open-source contributions  
- Building production-grade backend components and data pipelines  
- Securing a role where I can apply my experience in automation and backend engineering
