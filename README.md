# Andrei Sorin Stefan — Backend, Automation & Data Engineering

I specialize in backend systems, automation workflows, and data processing pipelines.  
My work focuses on reliability, clarity, and well-structured architecture rather than shortcuts or unstable solutions.  
I prefer clean, predictable systems that scale and can be extended without redesign.

## ⚙️ Technical Focus Areas

### 🔹 Backend Engineering
- Python (FastAPI, Flask, Django REST Framework)  
- REST API design, request validation, JWT authentication  
- Modular service architecture and clean data models  
- Secure session handling and business-logic oriented backend design  

---

### 🔹 Data Engineering & ETL Pipelines
- Large-scale data extraction (Selenium, undetected-chromedriver, requests)  
- Full ETL flows: collect → clean → transform → normalize → export (JSON/SQL/CSV)  
- Checkpointing, resumable executions, and fault-tolerant processing  
- HTML parsing, classification, and structured data output  
- PostgreSQL, SQLite, and JSON-based data pipelines  

---

### 🔹 Automation Engineering
- Browser automation with Selenium + stealth techniques  
- Proxy rotation, cookie/session isolation, multi-session orchestration  
- Human-like interaction modeling, timing control, form automation  
- Anti-bot evasion strategies and stability optimization  

---

### 🔹 Systems Engineering & DevOps
- Linux environments (Ubuntu, Debian) — deployment, administration, CLI workflows  
- Docker & Docker Compose — multi-service orchestration  
- Traefik — reverse proxy, routing, SSL, rate limits  
- Logging, monitoring, and scheduled automation (cron, systemd)  

---

### 🔹 Frontend Integration
- Vue 3 + TypeScript  
- Next.js (React)  
- SPA workflows connected to backend APIs  
- Functional, data-driven interfaces for automation and backend systems  

---

### 🔹 AI & Media Processing
- ONNX Runtime for model inference  
- OpenCV for video/image processing  
- FFmpeg for encoding, transformation, and batch automation

## 🧠 Core Expertise

- Backend architecture & API design  
- ETL and multi-stage data pipelines  
- Automation frameworks and workflow orchestration  
- Data normalization and structured exports  
- Containerized environments and Linux systems  
- Performance optimization for automation workloads  
- Predictable system design with maintainability in mind  

---

## 🎯 Professional Principles

- Build systems that are stable, not fragile  
- Maintain clean, readable, extensible codebases  
- Prefer logic-driven architecture over ad-hoc complexity  
- Optimize for maintainability and future expansion  
- Deliver solutions that work under real-world constraints (time, resources, load)
